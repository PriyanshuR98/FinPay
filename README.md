# Introduction
Welcome to the Amazon Customer Assistant Chatbot project, your friendly virtual shopping companion! In online shopping, we understand that finding the right product can sometimes be overwhelming. Imagine you're in a physical store looking for a TV, and a knowledgeable salesperson is there to assist you. They consider your room size, budget, and preferences to guide you towards the perfect choice. This personalized approach is what we call "Customer Obsession."
However, in the online shopping landscape, it often feels like you're navigating the vast digital aisles all by yourself. That's where the Amazon Customer Assistant Chatbot comes to the rescue. Our mission is to replicate the experience of having that friendly salesperson but in the digital realm. We are genuinely obsessed with ensuring your satisfaction as a customer.

# Project Overview
Our Goal
Our primary objective is to provide you with expert advice, recommendations, and suggestions, so you can confidently make the best choices when shopping on Amazon. Whether you're looking for a TV or any other product, our chatbot is here to simplify your online shopping journey.

# How It Works
Our chatbot is powered by a state-of-the-art Language Model (LLM) based on OpenAI API. When you interact with our chatbot, it uses this advanced model to understand your queries, preferences, and needs and generates a query based on all that information then we do a vector similarity search with our database based on the query generated by our LLM model. It then provides you with personalized, informative, and relevant responses, by matching just like a seasoned salesperson would in a physical store.
